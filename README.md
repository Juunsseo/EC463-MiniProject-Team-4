# 2025 Fall ECE Senior Design Miniproject

[ASSIGNMENT](./assignment/)

This project uses the Raspberry Pi Pico 2WH SC1634 (wireless, with header pins).

Each team must provide a micro-USB cable that connects to their laptop to plug into the Pi Pico.
The cord must have the data pins connected.
Splitter cords with multiple types of connectors fanning out may not have data pins connected.
Such micro-USB cords can be found locally at Microcenter, convenience stores, etc.
The student laptop is used to program the Pi Pico.
The laptop software to program and debug the Pi Pico works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

This miniproject focuses on using
[MicroPython](./doc/micropython.md)
using
[Thonny IDE](./doc/thonny.md).
Other IDE can be used, including Visual Studio Code or
[rshell](./doc/rshell.md).
